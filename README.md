# Why 
In the spirit of Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger I also plan on writing an annual investment letter detailing my investment strategy & results. As someone that enjoys teaching myself how to become a value investor I hope this file saves you some 
time & provides extremely pratically useful information. 

# How
All of my latest investment strategies that I'm open to sharing publically will be shared here & only here. I will periodically update this README.md file. 

All questions directed to me can be asked by creating an issue in this public repo. 

# What

I'm officially starting this at spacetime = `9/8 + 2021 + ~13.8*10^9?` in Amarillo, Texas, USA, Earth.

I will be comparing my investment results vs. the general market by comparing it to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF stock 
ticker = `VOO` & Warren & Charlie's Berkshire Hathaway stock ticker = `BRK.A`.
