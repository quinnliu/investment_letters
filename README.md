# Why
In the spirit of Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, & companies that I
admire I also plan on writing an annual investment letter detailing my
investment strategy & results. As someone that enjoys teaching myself how to
become a value investor I hope this file saves you some time & provides
extremely practically useful information.

# How
All of my latest investment strategies that I'm open to sharing publicly will be
shared here & only here. I will periodically update this `README.md` file.

All questions directed to me can be asked by creating an issue in this public
repo.

Charlie's Berkshire Hathaway stock ticker = `BRK.A`.
