# Why
In the spirit of Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger I also plan on writing an
annual investment letter detailing my investment strategy & results. As someone
that enjoys teaching myself how to become a value investor I hope this file
saves you some time & provides extremely practically useful information.

# How
All of my latest investment strategies that I'm open to sharing publicly will be
shared here & only here. I will periodically update this `README.md` file.

All questions directed to me can be asked by creating an issue in this public
repo.

# What

I'm officially starting this at spacetime = `10/23 + 2021 + ~13.8*10^9?` in
Amarillo, Texas, USA.

I will be comparing my total investment results versus the general market by
comparing it to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF stock ticker = `VOO` & Warren &
Charlie's Berkshire Hathaway stock ticker = `BRK.A`.

### Strategy from 10/23 + 2021 + ~13.8*10^9? to 1 year later
I find value investing extremely fascinating because it requires one to predict
which company of humans will improve in the future & which will not improve.

Sometimes this is extremely obvious with close to but never 100% probability.

Other times it is too complicated or outside of my current competence to
predict.

At it's core I find predicting the future an extremely difficult problem but
necessary to continually improve at.

How does one improve your body's ability to predict the future more accurately?

For most of human history a human can improve it's ability to predict the future
by imagining future possibilities within it's neocortex model of how
reality works.
